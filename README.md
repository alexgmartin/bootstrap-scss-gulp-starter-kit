This repo is a starter kit for front-end developer, so developers can easily start a new project without setting up everything all over again. I made two versions that would suit everyone: one is very basic that contain essential bootstrap files, and another is essential bootstrap files and gulp with SCSS compiler, browsersync and plumber.

## Bootstrap
* bootstrap.min.css
* jquery.1.11.3.min.js
* bootstrap.min.js

## Bootstrap-SCSS-Gulp
* bootstrap.min.css
* jquery.1.11.3.min.js
* bootstrap.min.js
* main.scss

And following Gulp tasks:
* BrowserSync
* SASS/SCSS compiler
* Plumber to prevent gulp crash on SASS/SCSS error

##### Install Dependencies
```
npm install
```

##### Start compiling, serving, and watching files
```
gulp
```
